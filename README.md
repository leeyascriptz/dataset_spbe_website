# file description
This dataset was created as part of research project to identify publicly exposed data and types of exposures.

# purpose of each dataset
1. dorking_syntax_.xlsx        : Determine which syntax will work to discover any potential data leakage.
2. finance_score_xlsx          : Assessing total score of each vulnerability type that are found in the _Finance and Development Planning_ category.

# purpose of each data visualization
1. finance_total_barchart.png     : Presenting the distribution and total count of data exposure in financial services.
2. governance_total_barchart.png  : Presenting the distribution and total count of data exposure in governance services.
3. security_total_barchart.png    : Presenting the distribution and total count of data exposure in security services.

# methodology
1. Constructed 10 Google Dorks Syntax that focused on finding potential data leakage in the government website
2. Focused on Indonesian 'go.id' government domains only (based on SPBE)
3. Manual searched using constructed Google Dorks
4. Collected data by using passive method only (no system was access or exploit)
5. Categorized findings based on type of exposed information
